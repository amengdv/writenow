# NestJS POC

A playground for me to play around with NestJS. It is not meant for showcasing anything.
A lot of the code inside this are full of bad code because it's focus more on functionality.
I don't care about writing good code for this POC around NestJS. I just want to see how
every component in NestJS interact with each other. This project does not even have to be finish.
once I learn what I need I can move on. But when I need to test something and apply something, this
is where I can come to.

## Feature Implemented

- User CRUD with auth and DB
